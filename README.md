# Rental Database

Search a customer in the database and print their rental history for a particular month and year. 

### Usage
Use the main function in rentals.py. Call the sakila_report(name, month, year) method to search and print the report. An example is present that can be edited, "sakila_report('Black', 6, 2005)." Ensure sakila211.db is in the same directory as rentals.py.
